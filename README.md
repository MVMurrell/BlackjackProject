Hello and Welcome to the Blackjack for Beginners. A great simulation for the amature Blackjack player.

Start by running the program. The objective of this game is to get as close to or exactly 21 with your hand of cards. Face cards are 10 points, numbered cards are face value, and Aces are 11 points.
you will be prompted for your name. After entering your name the game will begin by letting you know how much money you have to bet with, your hand, and the dealer's hand.  Enter the bet you would like to place. After doing so you will be asked if you would like to hit or stay. If you choose to hit you will be dealt another card until you bust(go over 21) or stay. If you stay you chose to forfeit any additional cards and the dealer will disclose his cards and hit until he reaches 17. Whomever gets closest to 21 wins.
